I am currently working as an Information Security Engineer with a total of 6 years of experience in the Information Technology (IT) realm. During this short time in the industry, I have been exposed to numerous amounts of tools in the technology stack. Some of these tools include Splunk, Mimecast, Barracuda, CrowdStrike, Cisco Umbrella, Carbon Black, Palo Alto, and many more. I have also been exposed to Active Directory, both on-premises and in the cloud with Azure, and Office 365. I obtained both the SC-200 and the SC-900 from Microsoft to obtain a foundational knowledge in Security on what the Azure platform has to offer.

In my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I took a course in system vulnerability and analysis, and it got me very interesting in the tools, tactics and techniques being used by hackers in the real world. I also have my master’s degree in Cybersecurity in December of 2021 where I was able to obtain my Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification from ECCouncil. I plan on using to block to post various write ups for the machines on TryHackMe as well as HackTheBox as well as personal tech projects that I am doing on the side.
